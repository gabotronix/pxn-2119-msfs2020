### Dead Zone and Sensitivity
I am not sure how both of these affect my controls, but I often experienced the aircraft's nose picthing up when turning left on the joystick. It seemed as if I was activating both Left+Down even though I only intended to go Left.

To resolve the issue, I accessed the SENSITIVITY settings of PXN-2119 from the Control options, then set the DEAD ZONE to a specific percentage. I arrived at 31% because it was the level at which I can turn left at a 30 degree angle before the pitch (up) intervened. I also set the sensitivity to 40%, as it seemed to make turning smoother.

There is a consequence to setting my dead zone at 31% though. I have to put a bit more effort when pulling back during a take off, or when ascending to a higher altitude.

I do not recommend messing with these settings unless you're having Joystick issues as well.
