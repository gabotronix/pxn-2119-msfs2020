Peripheral Settings for [PXN-2119](http://www.e-pxn.com/products/arcade-stick/pxn-2119) HOTAS on Microsoft Flight Simulator

The PXN-2119 is a poor simmer's HOTAS. It's the only HOTAS available in my region as of today. Regardless, it got me into MS Flight Simulator again after nearly two decades of absence. The last Flight Simulator I played was [2004: A Century of Flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2004:_A_Century_of_Flight). I sucked at the game back then, I still suck at it now.

In FS2020, the PXN-2119 has no name. It's probably because the Windows 10 driver for it is not in English. I didn't find a way, in-game or otherwise, to export the controls as an XML. So, this repo will have to be in the form of a documentation for now.

## How To Use This Repository
This repository contains text files that have button and axis assignments for several aircraft. If you're just getting started like me, you might want to check out the controls for the Cessna 152 as a starting point. It's the aircraft used in the training lessons.

## PXN-2119 Buttons and Axes
The PXN-2119 has 18 buttons, 6 axes, and 2 POV hats. The Throttle base is connected to the Joystick base via a PS2 connector (KB/mouse connector from the olden days). The Joystick base is then connected to the PC via USB:

**Axes**
1. Aileron axis = Joystick main control for flying
2. Rudder axis = Joystick twist (left and right); can be used for taxiing
3. Slider axis = behind the Joystick; can be used for flaps
4. Throttle axis
5. Small rotary axis = lower right of throttle
6. Large rotary axis = upper right of throttle; can be used to control mixture/turn off engine

**Buttons**
1. Trigger = Button 1; can be used for the main brake
2. Lower Trigger = Button 2; can be used for the parking brake
3. Buttons 3-6 = can be used to control elevator trim (3-4) and seat height (5-6)
4. Buttons 7-12 = located at the left of the joystick base; assign anything, such as the light toggle
5. Button 13 = on the lower right side of the throttle; can be a toggle for reverse thrust
6. Buttons 14-16 = can be used to toggle landing gear (14) and increase/decrease acceleration (14-15)

**POV Hats**
1. Joystick POV = can be used to control cockpit camer and external camera
2. Throttle POV = no idea what it can be used for
