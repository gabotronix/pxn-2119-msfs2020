# PXN-2119 for Microsoft Flight Simulator (FS2020)
Peripheral Settings for [PXN-2119](http://www.e-pxn.com/products/arcade-stick/pxn-2119) HOTAS on Microsoft Flight Simulator

The PXN-2119 is a poor simmer's HOTAS. Currently, it is the only HOTAS available in my region. Regardless, it got me into MS Flight Simulator again after nearly two decades of absence. The last Flight Simulator I played was [2004: A Century of Flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2004:_A_Century_of_Flight). I sucked at the game back then, I still suck at it now.

In FS2020, the PXN-2119 has no name. I didn't find a way, in-game or otherwise, to export the controls as an XML. So, this repo will have to be in the form of a documentation for now.
